# Priest Strapi

Running the priest CMS on a mongo db

and bringing all images to AWS 

```% yarn develop```

## Services

- CoverMedium should be an enum with 'video' 'photo' - this has been updated in Strapi but not yet Gatsby
- hasVideo | hasGallery etc I was having problems with booleans so I used numbers with 0 and 1 instead - test some booleans on a new build and implement them where I can - has gallery has now been updated as it works - this is more of a strapi note than a gatsby note
- sliderOne and Two are being depricated so I'm not uploading them yet

## Testimonials

I'm only only showing 5 star testimonials and not using the origins so currently stars and origins can be removed
